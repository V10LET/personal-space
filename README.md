Personal Space is a social platform that allows users to explore space using curated NASA data. Once selecting their account, explorers can browse the NASA archive for any space-related treasure — from telescopes and nebulas to satellites and black holes — alongside many other features, including:
+ update their account information
+ check-in daily for the astrological feature of the day
+ save images to their profile
+ edit or delete their saved universe findings, and...
+ retain their saves for the next time they want to traverse the universe.
