**Personal Space** is a social platform that allows users to explore space using curated NASA data. Once selecting their account, explorers can browse the NASA archive for any space-related treasure — from telescopes and nebulas to satellites and black holes — alongside many other features, including:
+ update their account information
+ check-in daily for the astrological feature of the day
+ save images to their profile
+ edit or delete their saved universe findings, and...
+ retain their saves for the next time they want to traverse the universe.

## Database
**Personal Space** stores user, planet and all association information in a PostgreSQL database powered by Ruby on Rails API — which you can find ![here](https://github.com/V10LET/personal-space-backend). The cors are set to global so anyone can access and/or manipulate the data on his or her local server. You will need grab the repo from ![personal-space-backend](https://github.com/V10LET/personal-space-backend) and ```$ bundle install``` the gem pack first, before running this repository's *index.html* file in your browser.
